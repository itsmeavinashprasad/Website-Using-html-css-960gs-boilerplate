              <h2> # It’s a healthy challenge</h2>
              <p>
                There are endless ways to challenge yourself with photography; you can always learn something new. There is no shortage of new techniques, genres, projects, equipment, inspiration, and workshops to take in this field. I’ve spent more than two years devouring photography information and I know there is still so much for me to learn and try.
                <br>
                I also see every picture as a challenge. It is like a puzzle I get to solve. How do I use what I’ve learned to capture this moment in time in a more powerful way, making my viewer linger longer and feel more?

              <h2> # It motivates you to experience more</h2>
              <p>
                With photography as a hobby, I always want to get the family out doing something. Even if it is just taking a walk or setting up a sprinkler in the backyard, I know that us doing anything together will give me opportunities to practice and capture great memories. Sometimes I feel a little guilty about my motivations, but I know that our whole family has gotten to experience so much more together because of my photography.

              <h2> # It connects you with others</h2>
              <p>
                Everyone loves a good picture, so photography is an easy way to connect to people. I love to be able to share our lives through my photos. It is another way to stay in contact with far away family and friends.
                <br>
                I also cannot say enough about how supportive and inspiring I’ve found the photography communities, such as Clickin Moms and Instagram. I’ve really enjoyed connecting with those around the world who share the same interest in learning to capture their lives better.

                <p>
                  Interest in photography websites has exploded over the last 10 years, largely thanks to the developments in digital photography. Cameras and computers have become cheaper and more powerful, software more sophistocated and printers can now print photos that are as good (if not better) than anything produced in a chemical darkroom. Now, once you’ve acquired a digital setup, the economic restrictions of film and development costs have been removed and the cost of photography is virtually nil.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Along with these developments in photography has been the parallel development of the Web. Ten years ago websites were largely clumsy, HTML driven constructions. Today, contemporary photographers have powerful tools such as WordPress and DreamWeaver with which to develop their websites. Photographers can also sell their work through companies such as PhotoShelter or ImageKind, and through photo libraries such as Alamy and iStockPhoto, opening up new revenue streams.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The result is that photographers are finding new and exciting ways to showcase their best work online. We took a look at some of the beautiful photography websites that we could find, analyzing the design trends and the reasons why these websites work.
